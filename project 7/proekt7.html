          <h1>Meta Side Table</h1>
          <p>
            The Meta Side Table is one of our <br>
            signature pieces and well suited to all <br>
            communal living spaces and bedrooms. <br>
            Consisting of a series of arranged, <br>
            powder coated rectangular and circular <br>
            shapes, Meta’s appearance changes from <br>
            delicate and thin, to substantial and full<br>
            depending on the viewing angle. <br>
            Featuring multi-directional storage for <br>
            your reading material and an even top for<br>
            decorative accessories.<br>

          <h1>Click Shelf</h1>
          <p>
            Click is a boltless shelving system. The <br>
            minimalistic form and construction, as <br>
            well as the visual lightness, form the <br>
            aesthetic characteristics of the shelf. <br>
            Constructed of 1.5mm thin sheet steel,a <br>
            girder and shelves, the system functions <br>
            similar to a construction kit. Only four <br>
            screws fix the girder together to which <br>
            the shelves are simply hung up without <br>
            any tools. The material and precision of<br>
            the components guarantee the stability <br>
            and assembly.<br>

          <h1>Float Shelf</h1>
          <p>
            Designed as a versatile storage option, <br>
            the Float Shelf is open to diverse <br>
            interpretations – holding a book as a <br>
            bedside or side table, bearing weight as <br>
            wall console, storing a magazine <br>
            collection, serving as a compact standing <br>
            desk, or safeguarding small personal<br>
            essentials as a hallway tray. The Float <br>
            Shelf equally adds a touch of character to <br>
            hotel rooms, boutique accommodation <br>
            and boardinghouses. Embodying purity <br>
            at its most elegant degree, the strict <br>
            geometry of this wall-mounted shelf <br>
            lends its form a sculptural appeal. The <br>
            Float Shelf consists of two offset levels <br>
            cut from a single sheet of aluminum, <br>
            with a simple two-fold composition<br>
            allowing for flexible placement, use and <br>
            display. Referencing the reduced <br>
            aesthetic principles of modernism in the <br>
            Bauhaus tradition, its design distils the <br>
            essence of a shelf.<br>
